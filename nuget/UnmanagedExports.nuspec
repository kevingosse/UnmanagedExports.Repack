    <description>Repackaging of UnmanagedExports 1.2.7 to be compatible with PackageReference.
	
	A set of compile-time libraries (nothing to deploy) and a build task that enable you to export functions from managed code to native applications.
      That means, you can create plugins in a managed language like C# or F# for native applications that only have a C-Api (like Notepad++).
      The nuget package is all you need. Just mark your methods with [DllExport] and build for x86, x64 or ia64.

      Hints:
      - You have to set your platform target to either x86, ia64 or x64. AnyCPU assemblies cannot export functions.
      - The export name defaults to the method name and the calling convention to stdcall. If that's all what you want, you can just use [DllExport] without parameters.
      - You cannot put your exports in generic types or export generic methods. (The CLR wouldn't know what type parameters to use)</description>
    <summary>Adds the ability to declare unmanaged function exports.
      IOW: the exact opposite of how DllImport works.</summary>
